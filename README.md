# Dar-Seranity

Dar-Seranity is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, designed as a house rental platform inspired by services like Airbnb and local house rental websites. Developed as part of an internship project for Data & Services, it represents the second full-stack project i created for the company.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Dar-Seranity is to provide a real-world application for exploring and learning Next.js while demonstrating the ability to create a full-stack product. By leveraging inspirations from existing platforms and incorporating creative features developed through research, this project serves as a portfolio piece showcasing my skills in web development and innovative thinking.

## Features

- Next.js framework for server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.
- Implementation of features inspired by popular rental platforms like Airbnb.
- Socket.IO integration for real-time communication in the application.
- Hosted online, accessible for testing as both a renter and a landlord at [Dar-Seranity](https://dar-seranity.vercel.app/).
